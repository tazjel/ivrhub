    <div class='span12'>
        <p>This is a skeleton Flask app using mongodb.</p>

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='span4'>
                <strong>Roles</strong>
                <p>There are two roles: <code>admins</code> and <code>normals</code>.  Admins can see things like the user directory.  They can also edit anyone's profile (though not their password).</p>
            </div>
            <div class='span4'>
                <strong>Signup flow</strong>
                <p>Users are asked to register and are sent the typical email with a confirmation link.  There is another hurdle, however: after the confirmation is clicked, an admin is notified.  The admin has to <em>verify</em> this person's identity and then toggle an entry in the webapp.  Only then will full access to the site be granted.  This is perhaps a bit silly and may be done away with in the future..</p>

                <strong>Source</strong>

                <strong>Forgotten password flow</strong>
                <p>User visits <code>/forgot</code> and submits an email address.  If that address is known, send it a message with a link to <code>/forgot/&lt;code&gt;</code>.  This shows a two-input page asking for a new password.  Save it and redirect to login.</p>
